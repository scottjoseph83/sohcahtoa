 "Images depicting both vernacular and applied examples of typography found within the built environment act as a primary outline to question the purpose of information and its visualisation within economic and socially democratic and capitalist systems, challenging the role of societal meritocracy and class structure, prompting thought toward non-canonical forms of writing.",
 "In such short lines are the movement of time, populous and even the weather, in which exist similar, if not exacting traits of occurrence. The same might be said of every segregated anachronistic letter, of every typographic arrangement primarily, but also of the thought and writing of every configuration of every piece of communication, be it typed or written, by every person in the world throughout history.",
 "This series was featured in Idea magazine, Tokyo, Japan, the international journal for graphic arts and typography, in the format of four visual and inter-textual articles, within a two year cycle of the journals calendar, spanning c. 10,000 words, in conjunction to 90+ full-colour offset printed original photographs.",

   "longDescription": [
"'Combination Printing' was a neologism used in the 19th century for identifying what came to be known as 'photo-montage'. Produced by using two or more photographic negatives as a singular image 'combination printing' was discovered and utilised as a technique by Hippolyte Bayard.",
"These 'Combination Prints' are constructed through the individual collection of singular objects in built environments, and go through an editing phase whereby the objects are montaged into a formal register, and then into a finite image.",
"The objects are archived in a method which dismembers their image-orientated-artefact status, and are ordered through a classical categorisation approach kindred to physical indexical systems, i.e. by being placed in A4 and A3 archival boxes in denominations relative to an objects size, colour, material, weight or volume.",
"The provenance of the elements are yet to be fully identified, although an intention exists to collate a segregated process in which a mirror of the object and image based components are likewise made visible, in the form of a text.",
